Write a cold outreach email to a CTO who has never heard of your product. The email must:
- Have a compelling subject line
- Reference a specific pain point (data silos, manual ETL, compliance risks)
- Include a clear value proposition with a quantified benefit
- End with a soft call-to-action (not "buy now" — think "15 min chat")
- Be under 200 words in the body
- Sound human, not templated

Use the AI to iterate until you have an email you'd actually send.`,
